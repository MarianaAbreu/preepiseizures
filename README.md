# PreEpiSeizures

PreEpiSeizures Project Code - Multimodal Prediction and Monitoring of Epilepsy

## ACC Seizure Detection

This project includes a pull request with functions to process raw data into ACC features and a model for seizure detection. 

### Data Processing

The data processing functions take raw data and convert it into ACC features. This involves several steps, including filtering, normalization, and feature extraction.

### Seizure Detection Model

The seizure detection model uses the processed ACC features to predict seizures. The model has been trained and validated on a large dataset of seizure events.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Then, you can run the data processing functions on your raw data and use the seizure detection model to make predictions.
